                            <p>Sentiment analysis lets you analyze the sentiment behind a given piece of text. 
In this article, we will look at how it works along with a few practical applications.
</p><h1>What is Sentiment Analysis?</h1><p>Sentiment analysis is a technique through which you can analyze a piece of text to determine the sentiment behind it. It combines machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to achieve this.
</p
><p>Using basic Sentiment analysis, a program can understand whether the sentiment behind a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral.
</p><p>It is a powerful technique in Artificial intelligence that has important business applications. </p><p>For example, you can use sentiment analysis to analyze customer feedback. 
After collecting that feedback through various mediums like Twitter and Facebook, 
you can run sentiment analysis algorithms on those text snippets to understand your customers'
 attitude towards your product
</p>
<h1>How Sentiment Analysis Works</h1>
<p>The simplest implementation of sentiment analysis is using a scored word list.</p>
</p><p>Let's say we had the phrase, "I love<strong> </strong>cats, but I am <strong>allergic </strong>to them".</p>
<p>list, you can find two words, “love” and “allergic” with their respective scores of +3 and -2. You can ignore the rest of the words (again, this is very basic sentiment analysis). </p>
<p>By combining these two, you get a total score of +1. So you can classify this sentence as mildly positive

<p>Brand monitoring is another great use-case for sentiment analysis. Companies can use sentiment analysis to check the social media sentiments around their brand from their audience.</p>
<p>KFC is a perfect example of a business that uses sentiment analysis to track, build, and enhance its brand. KFC’s social media campaigns are a great contributing factor to its success. They tailor their marketing campaigns to appeal to the young crowd and to be “present” in social media.</p>
